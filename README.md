# RocketSim
This is the supporting code for an ongoing research project / independent study into different control systems and their effects on the stability of a thrust vector controlled rocket simulation.
I will attempt to keep any relavant citations up to date in this repository, but consider everything to be in draft state and therefore some work / inspiration may be uncited.

I also note that I use Github Copilot to assist in the writing of some of the code.
