- Cleanup code and format properly to be OO and inheritance based
  - Simulation class should be clean
  - Avoid unenessecary use of static vars or direct data sharing
- Add all useful parameters to the dataLogger, especially in the main simulation
- Get the PID working as well as the python version. Figure out what is different
- Switch to a runner or builder pattern for the simulator
- Create another for hardcoded (i.e presets) simulations
- Fix the bug where the sim stops and fails when the lookahead point reaches the end
- Create a test runner that allows for command line arguments to run the simulation
- Create one that will read in parameters from a file and run every simulation listed
